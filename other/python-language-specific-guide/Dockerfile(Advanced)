# ARG: Makes Python version configurable at build time
# slim: Smaller base image (saves ~800MB vs full Python image)
ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.9.6
FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim as base

# Prevents Python from writing pyc files, to reduce size of image and cleaner container.
# A .pyc file is a Python compiled file that contains bytecode, which is a low-level representation of your Python source code.
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

# Keeps Python from buffering stdout and stderr to avoid situations where
# the application crashes without emitting any logs due to buffering.
# Forces Python to print output immediately (better logging)

# Create a non-privileged user that the app will run under.

# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.
# Leverage a cache mount to /root/.cache/pip to speed up subsequent builds.
# cache mount: Persists pip cache between builds (faster rebuilds)
# Leverage a bind mount to requirements.txt to avoid having to copy them into
# bind mount: Uses requirements.txt without copying it first
# into this layer.
# Separate step: Dependencies cached independently of code changes
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    --mount=type=bind,source=requirements.txt,target=requirements.txt \
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Switch to the non-privileged user to run the application.
USER appuser

# Copy the source code into the container.
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application listens on.
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application.
CMD python3 app.py




# Issues with Your Current Setup
# USER appuser before COPY: The non-root user can't write files

# Missing host binding: Flask won't accept external connections

# Quick Fix
# Change the last lines to:

# USER root
# COPY . .
# RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app
# USER appuser
# EXPOSE 5000
# CMD python3 -c "import app; app.app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)"


# This Dockerfile prioritizes security and build performance over simplicity.
